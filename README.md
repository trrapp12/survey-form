### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME:

* Before I began this assignment I never realized how much detail went into making semantic HTML.  This was a great course to build that knowledge.

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED:

- [X] all work is completely my own.  The only directions were user stories the assignment needed to complete.
